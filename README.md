GIF above represents the usage of my To-Do List. You can add a new task by typing it in the 'Co jest do zrobienia?' (What needs to be done?) field, and then add it to the list using the 'Dodaj zadanie' (Add task) button.
You can change the status of a task to 'done' by clicking the green button. Alternatively, if you want to delete a specific task, you can click the red button.
